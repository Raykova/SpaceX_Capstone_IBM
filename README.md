# SpaceX_Capstone_IBM
### Project Background
  The Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and SpaceX companies are aiming to make space travel more affordable. SpaceX is known to be the most successful. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a cost of 62 million dollars, whereas other providers cost their service 165 million dollars. The difference is due to the reuseble first stage of SpaceX. Here, I am taking the role of a Data Scientist working to predict a better price than SpaceX. To achieve that, I used publicly provided information to train a machine learning model and predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

### The Capstone course contents
  Through this course, I had an opportunity to complete a statitsical analysis where I predicted the factors impacting the successful landing of Falcon 9 rocket. 
To achieve the latter, I used Data Science methodologies starting with data collection followed by data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizating the data, building and evaluating models, and presenting the project deliverables to stakeholders.
