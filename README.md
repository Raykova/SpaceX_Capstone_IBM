## The Capstone course materials
Through this course, I had an opportunity to complete a statitsical analysis where I predicted the factors impacting the successful landing of Falcon 9 rocket. 
To achieve the latter, I used Data Science methodologies starting with data collection followed by data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizating the data, building and evaluating models, and presenting the project deliverables to stakeholders.
